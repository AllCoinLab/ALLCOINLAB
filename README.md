# Introduction of myself
Hello  
I have invented **SO MANY UNIQUE IDEAS** for the crypto.  
Things may attract investors like auto-liquidity, reflection, reward, etc.  
As I have ability to make it as a reality,  
working on integrating many of them to the UpFinity Project.  

# Job
I am looking for a job  
Also looking for people to do a work for UpFinity  

# Skills
## Smart Contract: **TOP TIER (Please tell me who can do better than me)**  
(ex: https://github.com/UpFinityCrypto/UpFinityCrypto.github.io/blob/master/UpFinity.sol)  
simplified one https://github.com/AllCoinLab/TheWeb3Project/blob/main/TheWeb3Project.sol  
web3.py + python: TOP TIER (done many things: arbitrage, snipe, bot, frontrun, backrun, etc)  
web3.js + js: High Tier  
Website Development: High Tier (Full Stack. html/css/js/react/django/python/php)  
Others are not high tier or not learned yet.  
But doesn't matter. I learn REALLY FAST :)  

# I have invented
All of these features are WORKING in the UpFinity Project

## Sell Recovery Algorithm
All Buyback systems are INCOMPLETE due to below issues:  
1. Buyback happens BEFORE the sell
So profit is given to sellers and taken from the buyers and holders.
2. Buyback is NOT PROPORTIONAL to the sell amount  
So invulnerable to the bot attacks with multiple small sells.  
And also has low effect on the big sells.
3. Buyback contract needs fund. A BIG FUND.
It should have certain amount compared to the liquidity.  
It means portion of the liquidity fund should be allocated to the buyback,  
which means liquidity fund will be always much more smaller.  
4. Cannot start with small liquidity
Due to issue 3, liquidity + buyback fund should be high enough to handle many transactions  
**So I have invented this 'sell recovery algorithm' which solves ALL issues above.**
Especially, buyback happens AFTER the sell, which is a TRUE buyback.

## Preservable Reward Algorithm
All reward system are INCOMPLETE due to below issues:  
1. Reward amount is not preservable to each wallet  
2. Due to issue 1, forces people to do periodic claim  
3. Due to issue 2, Unclaimed Reward Size cannot grow  
**So I have invented this 'sell recovery algorithm' which solves ALL issues above.**

## Non-decreasing Holder Count Algorithm
Holder count fluctuates due to buy/sell  
I have invented algorithm to make full sellers to stay as a actual holder.  
It was intended to track all the sellers to provide a new feature in the future,  
but it also had this effect  

## Impact Tax Algorithm
Tax is proportional on the price impact

## Penalty Tax Algorithm
Tax is accumulated based on the total sell amount during time window

## Circuit Breaker Algorithm
If price drops for certain amount, special effect happens.
Previous special effect was 'Cannot Sell'  
Now changed to 'decrease buy tax and increase sell tax'  

## Dip Reward Algorithm
Special token is proportionally added to the buy transaction until the new ATH

## First Penguin Algorithm
If someone buys after the sell, buy tax is decreased.  
if someond sells after the buy, sell tax is increased.
